## Day 6: Deployment and Final Touches  
**By Rubab Fatima**  

The final day of the Marketplace Buhackathon was the culmination of all our efforts throughout the event. This day was critical as we completed the project and ensured it met all the functional, security, and performance standards. Below is a detailed account of everything I accomplished on the last day:  

### 1. Finalizing the E-Commerce Website  
- The entire Nike-themed e-commerce platform was polished to ensure it was fully functional and ready for deployment.  
- Verified that all features, including **Add to Cart**, **Checkout**, **Wishlist**, **Search Bar**, and **Sign-In**, worked seamlessly across various devices.  

### 2. Deployment on Vercel  
- Deployed the completed website on **Vercel**, making it accessible through a live link.  
- Carefully configured the deployment settings to ensure the project ran efficiently on the server.  
- Conducted multiple checks to confirm that all pages loaded correctly and the website was fully operational in the deployed environment.  

### 3. Security Enhancements  
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as API keys and database credentials were securely stored in environment variables to protect them from being exposed publicly.  
- Verified that the `.env` file was excluded from version control, ensuring that the project followed best security practices.  

### 4. Performance Testing  
- Used **PageSpeed Insights** to evaluate the website’s speed, responsiveness, and overall performance.  
- Achieved impressive performance scores by optimizing images, reducing unnecessary code, and ensuring fast API response times.  
- Noted key metrics like **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Time to Interactive (TTI)** to assess user experience.  

### 5. Generating a CSV Report  
- Created a **CSV file** documenting all performance metrics, including:  
  - API response times.  
  - Lighthouse scores for desktop and mobile.  
  - Testing results for individual features like product listing, cart functionality, and user authentication.  
- This report served as a comprehensive summary of the project’s performance and testing phases.  

### 6. Thorough Testing  
- Conducted extensive testing across all features of the website to ensure they were bug-free.  
- Validated that the backend handled requests correctly and that the frontend displayed data accurately.  
- Tested user scenarios like adding products to the cart, completing the checkout process, and managing the wishlist to simulate real-world usage.  

### 7. Final Review and Feedback  
- Collaborated with teammates to review the deployed website and gather feedback for any last-minute changes.  
- Ensured that the **user interface (UI)** was visually appealing and aligned with the Nike brand theme.  
- Confirmed that the website was ready for presentation to judges and end-users.

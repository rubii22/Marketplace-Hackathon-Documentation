## Day 1: Ideation and Business Concept Presentation  
The hackathon began with an exciting task to ignite our creativity: we were asked to propose a business idea using just a pencil and paper. I presented a unique and innovative concept for an e-commerce platform designed to enhance customer experience. The idea laid the foundation for the project, ensuring a clear vision for the days ahead.

- Developed a **roadmap** to outline the step-by-step process for building the e-commerce website.  
This phase was critical to setting a solid foundation for the project.

These additions made the platform interactive and ready for real-world use.
